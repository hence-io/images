# In Drupal 8, we must also match new paths where the '.php' appears in the middle,

# with the update.php front controller.  This allows legacy path aliases in the form of
# blog/index.php/legacy-path to continue to route to Drupal nodes. If you do not have
# any paths like that, then you might prefer to use a laxer rule, such as:
#   location ~ \.php(/|${DOLLAR}) {
# The laxer rule will continue to work if Drupal uses this new URL pattern with front
# controllers other than update.php in a future release.
